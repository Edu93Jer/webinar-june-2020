        "I'm full-stack developer used to work as logistics advisor, but now I decided to start working as a developer,
        helping people designing innovative software solutions. When I entered Ironhack my knowledge of programming was
        scarce, almost nil; but thanks to the dedication and desire to get ahead in development, I ended up being the
        winner of 3 projects in each of the corresponding modules. Now I feel prepared and ready to start working as a
        full-stack developer!"
